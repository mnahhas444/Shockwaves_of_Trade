We analyze how exposure to Chinese import competition impacts distress measures within 
communities, including mass shooting probability, opioid-related deaths, suicides, poverty 
rates, and inequality. Using Ordinary Least Squares Methodology, we uncover a puzzling 
link between exposure and inequality, potentially reducing shooting probabilities. 
Additionally, we find a significant increase in shooting probability after a previous mass 
shooting incident, a novel finding in the literature. We recommend policymakers consider 
exposure as a monitoring variable to understand risks within their countyâ€™s socioeconomic 
fabric. Full paper and results can be found on my Linkedin page: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-v-nahhas/
